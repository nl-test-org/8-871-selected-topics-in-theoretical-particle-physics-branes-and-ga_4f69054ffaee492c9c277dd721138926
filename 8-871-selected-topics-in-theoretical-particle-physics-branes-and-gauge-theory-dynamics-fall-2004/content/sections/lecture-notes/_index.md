| 1 | Introduction to Branes  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Branes Ending on Branes  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}5 Superstring Theories, 11d Supergravity | For today's lecture, we have the following references:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}\- [Open _p_\-Branes](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9512059) (Strominger)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}\- [String Theory Dynamics in Various Dimensions (Witten)](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124) |
| 2-3 | Central Charges in the Supersymmetry Algebra  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Branes in Type II Theories  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Dualities in String Theory  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Tensions of Branes | Weinberg, Steven. _The Quantum Theory of Fields_. Vol. 3. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1995-2000. ISBN: 9780521660006.  {{< br >}}A good reference for Supersymmetry algebras in higher dimensions can be found in chapter 32 of Weinberg's book, _The Quantum Theory of Fields_ (Vol. 3). In particular see 32.2 for the massless supermultiplets.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The central extension to the supersymmetry algebra was first discussed in a paper by Witten Olive.  {{< br >}}In this paper there is an explicit computation of the extension for a two dimensional theory with N=2 supersymmetry (4 supercharges). In this paper there is also a central extension for the N=2 theory in 4 dimensions (8 supercharges). The paper derives the BPS bound for the two algebras as a result of the existence of these central charges.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The discussion we had today is a (straightforward) generalization of this paper. One replaces particles by branes and generalizes the number of space-time dimensions. The central extension for a _p_\-brane becomes a _p_\-form in the supersymmetry algebra instead of a 0-form for a particle.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}A treatment of the central charge for 11d supergravity can be found in M-Theory from its Super algebra (Townsend). ([PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9712004v4))  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}A derivation of the BPS bound which is the generalization of the Witten Olive computation can be found.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}[A good source for SL(2,Z) duality of Type IIB is An SL(2,Z) Multiplet of Type IIB Superstrings (J.

| 4-5 | Supergravity in Various Dimensions - 32 Supercharges  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Scalar Manifolds in Various Dimensions  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Cosmic Strings | For collected works on supergravity in various dimensions see:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Salam, A., and E. Sezgin, eds. _Supergravity In Diverse Dimensions._ North-Holland: World Scientific, 1989.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}For a discussion on scalar manifolds in various dimensions see for example [Hull and Townsend](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9410167).  {{< br >}}Tables 1 and 2 summarize the results.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}[For a recent revival of the topic of cosmic strings in string theory see Copeland, Myers, and Polchinski](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0312067). |
| 6-7 | u-dualities and Representations of _p_\-forms  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Electric and Magnetic Excitations on Branes  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}SYM Actions in Various Dimensions  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Higgs Mechanism - Adjoint Representation | A nice treatment of anomalies in various dimensions can be found in the review paper of Alvarez-Gaume and Ginsparg.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}In this paper there is a topological interpretation of the anomalies in terms of some index theorems. The 2 dimensional extension of the manifold for which the anomaly in calculated is described in section 3 where this 2 dimensional extension turns out to be a 2-sphere. A summary of the ideas can be found in section 4. This reference answers in great detail all questions which were asked today in class about the derivation of the anomaly in even dimensions.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}[A good source for the properties of supergravity theories in various dimensions can be found in Introduction to Supergravities in Diverse Dimensions](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9802138) (Tanii). |
| 8-9 | Brane Realization of Classical Groups for Theories with 16 Supercharges  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}McKay Correspondence  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Orientifolds  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Central Charge Formulas for W Bosons  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Root Systems of Lie Algebras | [A good review of string dualities can be found in the paper of lectures on Superstring and M Theory Dualities (Schwarz)](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9607201).  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The next lecture, will be focused on the brane realization of the classical groups A, B, C, D for theories with 16 supercharges. We will learn for the first time in the course the deep connection between geometry and algebra as realized by the branes. We will cover orientifolds on their various types and learn about central charge formulas for W bosons and their relation to the root systems of the lie algebras. |
| 10-11 | BPS Objects Living on Branes  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Instantons  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Monopoles  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Brane Realization of E\_n Gauge Theories  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}E\_n Representation Theory, Root Systems  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Supergravity Multiplets - 16 Supercharges, Vector Multiplets and Tensor Multiplets  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Gravitational Anomalies | In Lec #10, we will go over the BPS objects on the world-volume of various branes. For gauge theories (which as is familiar by now live on D branes) these include the instanton and the 't Hooft Polyakov monopole.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Next, we will discuss compact space-times with orientifolds and learn about the brane realization of E\_n gauge theories. This will be the first non-perturbative dynamical result which can not be verified by the usual methods in perturbation theory.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}These are two possible references for learning about monopoles and instantons:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Cheng, Ta-Pei, and Ling-Fong Li. _Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics._ Oxford, NY \[Oxfordshire\]: Clarendon Press; New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1984. ISBN: 9780198519560, 9780198519614. (Paperback.)  {{< br >}}Cheng and Li (in their book, _Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics_) discuss the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole in chapter 15 and the instanton in chapter 16. Their discussion is of course in 4 dimensions. The generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward and assumes that the extra directions are spectators. They also give the original references.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Weinberg, Steven. _The Quantum Theory of Fields._ Vol. 2. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780521550024.  {{< br >}}Weinberg's volume two includes a very lucid treatment of instantons and monopoles (again in 4d) in chapter 23.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Another useful reference for the classical monopole solutions can be found in the paper by Gibbons and Manton.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Polchinski, Joseph Gerard. _String Theory_. Vol. 1. Cambridge, UK; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 278. ISBN: 9780521633031. (Hardcover.)  {{< br >}}There is a brief discussion by Polchinski on the reflection and incident gravitational waves on an orientifold plane. This is a possible answer to a question which was discussed in class about the non-dynamical nature of the orientifold plane. |

We will also learn about some aspects of the moduli space of E\_n instantons.
